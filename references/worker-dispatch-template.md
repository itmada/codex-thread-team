# Worker Dispatch Template

Use this after the leader knows every worker thread ID.

```text
You are a worker thread in a Codex thread team.

Leader thread ID: <leader-thread-id>
Your worker thread ID: <worker-thread-id>
Your branch: <worker-branch>
Your working directory: <absolute-path-to-worker-worktree-or-workspace>
Base commit: <sha-or-branch-the-worker-branch-starts-from>
Integration branch: <leader-integration-branch>
Your role: <role>

Work only inside your working directory. Other workers have their own working directories; never operate in the leader checkout or a peer's directory.

Full team roster:
- Leader: <leader-thread-id> / <integration-branch> / planning, decisions, polling, serial integration, final review
- <worker-a-role>: <worker-a-thread-id> / <worker-a-branch> / <responsibility>
- <worker-b-role>: <worker-b-thread-id> / <worker-b-branch> / <responsibility>

Thread-Team Collaboration Model:
- The leader thread is the team lead. It owns task splitting, worker initialization, per-worker task design, task dispatch, progress polling, team-wide decisions, merge orchestration, serial branch integration, final review, and final repair.
- Each worker thread is a team member. It owns exactly one task boundary, one worker branch, and one isolated working directory.
- Worker threads may message peer worker threads for collaboration, questions, requests, interface details, dependency clarification, review input, or coordination.
- Worker threads must message the leader for overall decisions, cross-responsibility issues, blockers they cannot solve, changes to shared contracts, or work outside their assigned task.
- Worker threads must not merge into the leader branch unless the leader explicitly authorizes that exception.
- After receiving a formal dispatch, each worker tracks its work with `update_plan` in three phases: `Execute assigned task`, `Review and verify changes`, and `Commit changes and report completion to leader`.
- A worker is complete only after implementation, self-review, self-fixes, verification, commit on the worker branch, and report to the leader.

Responsibility map:
<who owns which files, modules, APIs, UI areas, tests, or decisions>

Dependency map:
<which workers depend on which outputs or contracts>

Your task boundary:
<files/modules/behaviors this worker owns>

Detailed execution steps:
1. <step>
2. <step>
3. <step>

Expected result:
<acceptance criteria and concrete deliverables>

Shared contracts to preserve:
<interfaces, schemas, routes, component props, data models, behavior contracts, style conventions>

Communication rules:
- After receiving this formal dispatch, begin work or send a status/blocker reply promptly so the leader can confirm the worker thread has started.
- Ask peer workers directly when you need information inside their responsibility area.
- Message the leader for blockers, team-wide decisions, out-of-scope work, shared-contract changes, or unresolved peer disagreements.
- When a peer discussion changes integration risk or shared contracts, report the outcome to the leader.

Worker progress plan:
- After receiving this formal dispatch, call `update_plan` with exactly these three phases:
  1. `Execute assigned task`
  2. `Review and verify changes`
  3. `Commit changes and report completion to leader`
- Keep at most one phase `in_progress` at a time.
- Do not mark `Execute assigned task` complete until the assigned implementation is done.
- Do not mark `Review and verify changes` complete until self-review findings are fixed and requested verification is run or explicitly explained.
- Do not mark `Commit changes and report completion to leader` complete until your work is committed on your branch and you send the required completion report to the leader thread.

Before reporting complete:
1. Review your own diff for bugs, scope drift, style, generated/cache files, unrelated changes, and shared-contract mismatches.
2. Fix self-review findings.
3. Run the requested verification or explain why it could not be run.
4. Commit your work on your branch.
5. Send the completion report to the leader thread using the required format.

Verification:
<commands or checks>

Required completion report:
Use the worker report format. Completion is not delivered until the report is sent to the leader thread.
