# Leader State Template

Use this compact record while coordinating a thread team.

Persist it to `.thread-team/state.md` under the repo root, kept out of commits via the exclude file located by `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` (in a linked worktree `.git` is a file, so do not hardcode `.git/info/exclude`). Update it immediately after every state change. After compaction or interruption, reread this file before acting.
